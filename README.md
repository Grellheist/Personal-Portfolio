# This code is "temporary"

This is my personal portfolio, and you can access it
<a href="https://www.victorbuntrok.com">here</a>.

I will eventually change everything about it, including migrating it from
Python/Flask/Bootstrap to NextJS with Tailwind and Typescript.

For now though, it will stay as it is.

# Version 2.0

Now that I've finished my <a
href="https://real-time-chat-production-2f34.up.railway.app/">real time
chat</a> project, I will start the version 2.0 of my portfolio.

I will be using NextJS (Typescript + Tailwind) and will try making it look good
(frontend not really my thing lol).
